<!-- clipToPadding specifies whether padding should cut into the
   - view bounds, and hence into the children. To us, setting
   - this to false has the effect of padding the bottom with
   - extra space so the FAB isn't covering the last item
   - when we scroll to it.
   -
   - An outsideOverlay scrollbarStyle means the scrollbar is drawn
   - outside of the clipping boundary due to padding, and is laid over
   - the RecyclerView, rather than being inside of its container (which
   - mandates it being inset and adding to the view's padding).
